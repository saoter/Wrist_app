# üìÑ Wrist Vessel Invoice Extractor

This is an automated document processing pipeline built for Wrist. It watches a folder for new incoming PDF invoices, extracts structured data using a local LLM (Gemma 3 via Ollama), enriches it with vessel and customer database info, and saves the result as JSON files.

---

## üß† What It Does

1. **Monitors** the `documents/` folder for new PDF files.
2. **Extracts** key invoice fields from scanned PDFs using an LLM prompt (via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)).
3. **Enriches** the data with:
   - Lloyd's vessel registry data
   - Wrist MDM Customer database
4. **Compares** extracted vs. registered data (e.g. billing counterpart, billing address).
5. **Saves** structured results to `.json` and moves processed PDFs to `documents/processed/`.
